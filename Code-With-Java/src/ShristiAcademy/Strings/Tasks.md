## 🟢 Easy Level (Basics & Fundamentals)
1. Write a program to reverse a given string without using built-in reverse functions.
2. Determine whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
3. Count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
4. Remove all spaces from a given string without using replaceAll().
5. Find how many times a specific character appears in a string.
6. Verify if two given strings are anagrams of each other.
7. Convert all lowercase characters to uppercase and vice versa.
8. Find the length of a string without using `length()`.
9. Check whether one string is a substring of another using manual iteration.
10. Remove all duplicate characters from a string while keeping the first occurrence.

## 🟡 Intermediate Level (String Manipulation & Logic)
11. Find and print the first non-repeated character from a string.
12. Display the frequency of each character in a string (use `Map<Character, Integer>`).
13. Generate all possible permutations of the given string.
14. Given a sentence, find the longest word and its length. 
15. Convert the first letter of every word in a sentence to uppercase.
16. Check if one string is a rotation of another (e.g., “abcde” and “cdeab”).
17. Count the number of words in a given sentence without using split().
18. Remove all numeric characters from a given string.
19. Convert "aaabbcc" → "a3b2c2".
20. Verify if a given string contains only numbers (no letters or symbols).

## 🔴 Advanced Level (Algorithms & Optimization)
21. Find the longest substring that reads the same forwards and backwards.
22. Print all possible substrings of a string and count them.
23. Group a list of strings based on the vowels they contain.
24. Find all characters that appear in both strings, in order.
25. Given two strings `A` and `B`, remove all characters from `A` that appear in `B`.
